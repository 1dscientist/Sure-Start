# Sure-Start
 
## Day 1

I learned the basics of what we will be doing in the Future Makers program. I feel that this will be a great learning experience for me and I will be able to do many useful things from the skills I gather here. I look forward to participate in the MIT Future-Makers Create-A-Thon. 

## Day 2

I had some time to look at Dr. Kong's leadership development seminar today, but unfortunately was not able to attend all of it. In the time I was there, I learned that I can take action to make a postitive impact in my community, and be the change I want to see in my community. 

## Day 3

I learned about Supervised learning and Scikit-learn. Although I'm familiar with these topics, I really liked how I was clearly able to review these concepts and keep memory of them.

## Day 4

I learned about Deep Learning and the different kinds of Machine Learning Models. The three kinds were:
- Supervised: Input should go through a model and match a pretrained labled outcome
- Unsupervised: Input should go through a model and categorize outputs based on common traits
- Generative: Model that trains it self through doing more beneficial things and less adversarial things
