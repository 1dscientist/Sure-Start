# Sure-Start
 
## Day 1

I learned the basics of what we will be doing in the Future Makers program. I feel that this will be a great learning experience for me and I will be able to do many useful things from the skills I gather here. I look forward to participate in the MIT Future-Makers Create-A-Thon. 

## Day 2

I had some time to look at Dr. Kong's leadership development seminar today, but unfortunately was not able to attend all of it. In the time I was there, I learned that I can take action to make a postitive impact in my community, and be the change I want to see in my community. 

## Day 3

I learned about Supervised learning and Scikit-learn. Although I'm familiar with these topics, I really liked how I was clearly able to review these concepts and keep memory of them.

### Answers to Short Answer Questions
1. Supervised Learning is when you train a model based on a definite solution set, whereas unsupervised is when the computer clusters data based on similar traits/categories.
2. Scikit Learn does not have the power to visualize data as it needs input data to do the task. It takes the data from an array or pandas dataframe. Source: https://scikit-learn.org/stable/visualizations.html

## Day 4

I learned about Deep Learning and the different kinds of Machine Learning Models. The three kinds were:
- Supervised: Input should go through a model and match a pretrained labled outcome
- Unsupervised: Input should go through a model and categorize outputs based on common traits
- Generative: Model that trains it self through doing more beneficial things and less adversarial things

A real world example of applying Deep Learning is for something like Financial Timeseries prediction. This is especially helpful in finding patterns in stock prices with hundreds of diffrent factors that may influence it. The relationships found between variables in the financial dataset for a particular stock can unlock new levels of information that a regular linear regression model may not have.

See AlphaVantage.co for the dataset, its a free API limited to 5 calls a minute. 

## Day 7

1. Tensors are special kinds of data types that are multi-dimensional arrays of uniform type. These are used by neural networks to make more effective models and calculating linear algebra solutions.

2. I noticed that I needed to find ways of manipulating the data before doing the actual work with the model.

## Day 8

**Helpful Guide**: https://serokell.io/blog/deep-learning-and-neural-network-guide

I understood the fundementals of a neural network and a basic explanation of the different types of it.
- Feed Forward Neural Network: Simplest kind with no backpropogation
- Recurrent Neural Netowrk: Simple kind with backpropogation
- Convolutional Neural Network: Where inputs connected by a small square in the image and gets finer as it progresses in the network
- Generative Adversarial Neural Network: Unsupervised model that helps analyze deepfakes

## Day 9 

Convolutional Neural Networks are an interesting kind of neural network where data is efficiently optimized for tasks like Image Classification. I am currently using it to make my models more effective and interesting. Will update to this as I continue my CV journey!

## Day 10 

I really enjoyed playing the Survival game, and it exposed me to a reality I may have been oblivious to

1. I think that ML was used to scan through resum√©s and look for suitable candidates from the applicant pool.
2. When I think of a biased machine learning model, I may think of college application scanners which go through applications before holistic review. It may not consider external factors or the whole picture and make biased decisions immediately, causing unfortunate situations for the students involved.

## Day 11

MINST is an interesting Dataset that I hope to analyze. I've done it in the past but only using simple decision trees, which were not that accurate.
